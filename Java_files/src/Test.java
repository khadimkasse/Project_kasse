				+ "\"write once, run anywhere\" (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled "
				+ "Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the"
				+ " need for recompilation.[16] Java applications are typically compiled "
				+ "to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless"
				+ " of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular"
				+ " programming languages in use,[17][18][19][20] particularly for client-server"
				+ " web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21] Java was"
				+ " originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since "
				+ "been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component"
				+ " of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its "
				+ "syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either "
				+ "of them.";
